/* Return the length of the shortest path from any source to any dest in the undirected graph defined by the adjacency matrix A
using floyd algorithm.
   A is an NxN adjacency matrix stored in row-major. Assume the graph is connected. A is undirected.
   Use CUDA to compute in parallel. The kernel is launched on an NxN grid of threads.
   Example:
   
   input: [[0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0]]
   output: [[0, 1, 1, 2], [1, 0, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0, 1], [2, 1, 1, 0]]
