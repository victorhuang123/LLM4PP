/* Count the number of odd and even numbers in a given integer vector x
   Use MPI and OpenMP to compute in parallel. Assume MPI has already been initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of s. The result is stored in bins on rank 0.
   Examples:

   input: [7, 4, 3, 2, 1]
   output: [3, 2]

   input: [5, 3, 2 1]
   output: [3, 1]
