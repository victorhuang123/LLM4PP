/* Given a vector x, please return its Median. The Median is the middle value in an ordered integer vector. If the size of the vector is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.
   Use MPI and OpenMP to sort x in parallel. Assume MPI is already initialized.
   Every rank has a complete copy of x. Store the result in x on rank 0.
   Example:

   input: [2, 3, 4]
   output: 3

   input: [2, 3]
   output: 2.5
