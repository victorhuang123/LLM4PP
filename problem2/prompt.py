Your goal is to rewrite serial code to make it fast through parallel processing. The user will provide you with an original code snippet.

    ## Directions
    Please adhere to the following instructions for your response:
    1. Understand the Purpose: Briefly identify the main purpose of the original code provided by the user.
    2. Analyze for Optimization: Carefully examine the original code and highlight key opportunities for optimization, with a focus on resolving loop-carried dependencies and maximizing parallel performance.
    3. Provide Optimized Code: Rewrite the original code using OpenMP for parallelization, incorporating the optimizations identified in step 2. Ensure that the functionality and purpose of the original code are preserved while achieving better performance.

    ## Reference Examples
    Here are some examples of achieving good speed-ups while maintaining algorithm equivalence to the original code:
    ### Reference Code 1
    ```cpp
    {slow_code0}
    ```
    ### Optimized Code 1
    ```cpp
